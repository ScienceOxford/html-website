    <h1>Add Pictures to your Website</h1>
    <p>These instructions show you how to add pictures into your project.</p>

    <h3>Permissions</h3>
    <p>You can create an image yourself, using software on your device, or save an image to your computer after <a href="https://search.kidzsearch.com/kzimagesearch-copyright-free.php?q=duck&aff=&subid=&oq=duck&v=desktop#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=duck&gsc.page=1" target="_blank">searching online</a>.</p>
    <p>When choosing pictures, it is important to make sure that you have permission to use it, and it is always a good idea to thank whoever created it (if it does not belong to you), for example with a link to the website!</p>
    <p>By using the link below to search for pictures, you will make sure that you only find images that are <strong>Copyright Free</strong>, so you have permission to use them for education purposes.</p>
    <p><a href="https://search.kidzsearch.com/kzimagesearch-copyright-free.php?q=duck&aff=&subid=&oq=duck&v=desktop#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=duck&gsc.page=1" target="_blank">Image Search</a></p>
    <p>If you want to create a project to share online with people other than your family, you will need to be even more careful about how you choose your images.</p>
    <p><strong>Remember, do not include any photos of yourself or anyone you know in your app, as the information stored on Trinket is not private or secure!</strong></p>
    <br>

  <div id="use" class="left">
    <h3>Adding images to Trinket if logged in</h3>
    <p>Click the 'image' tab (see picture below), the 'Image Library', then 'Upload New Image'.</p>
    <p>Once it is uploaded, you can use the same picture as many times as you like in your project without having to upload it again!</p>
    <img src=".\images\upload-image.PNG" alt="upload a file screenshot" width="800px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Switch back to the tab your code is in e.g. 'index.html' and add the following code on a new line:</p>
    <pre> &#60;img src="your_image.png" alt="descriptive text" width="200px"></pre>
    <br>
    <p>Change "your_image.png" to the name of your image, add descriptive text and choose your size.</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="use" class="left">
    <h3>Adding images to Trinket if not logged in</h3>
    <p>It is slightly more complicated to use images if you are not logged in, as you cannot upload them into Trinket.</p>
    <p>Visit <a href="https://imgbb.com/upload" target="_blank">imgbb</a> and upload your picture. Choose how long you want to keep the picture for (the maximum is 1 month), then click <strong>Upload</strong>.</p>
    <img src=".\images\upload-image-imgbb.PNG" alt="upload image screenshot" width="1000px" height="auto">
    <p>Once the image has successfully uploaded (this might take a little while if it is a large picture!), change the <strong>Embed codes</strong> to <strong>HTML full linked</strong></p>
    <img src=".\images\embed-image.PNG" alt="embed image screenshot" width="600px" height="auto">
    <p>Copy the given code and add it to your own program in the correct place.</p>
